## **Optimizing Electrolytic Hydrogen Production: Energy Efficiency through Production Rate Control at Hydrogen Fuel Stations**

**_Abstract_: Hydrogen has been getting a lot of attention recently as an alternative fuel source to power vehicles due to its high energy density, and environment-friendly nature. Many vehicle manufacturers are developing hydrogen fuel engines, hydrogen engine powered cars, and trucks. Many hydrogen powered cars are already in production and being sold (although in small amount now), but this number is increasing and expected to increase in the future. To support those cars, more and more hydrogen fuel stations are currently being built. Some fuel stations are expected to have their own hydrogen production system. And since hydrogen production can be costly, and energy intensive, this project revolves around developing a model for the controlled optimum production of hydrogen for such fuel station to increase efficiency, which is desired. In this project, a model was developed that tries to minimize the energy required for the production of hydrogen by controlling the production rates throughout the day while ensuring that all the expected demand of hydrogen for the entire day is completely met. The model was simulated and expected results were observed. The results demonstrated how effective the model was at optimizing energy use in hydrogen production by controlled production rate.**
